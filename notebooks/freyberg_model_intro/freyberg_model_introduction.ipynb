    "### We have recreated a MODFLOW model that was originally created by David Freyberg at Stanford University in the late 1980s. The  model is a 2-dimensional MODFLOW model with 1 layer,  40 rows, and 20 columns.  The model has 2 stress periods: an initial steady-state stress period used for calibration, and a 10-year transient stress period.  The calibration period uses the recharge and well flux of Freyberg(1988); the forecast stress period uses 25% less recharge and 25% more pumping to represent future drought conditions for a forecast period."
